# embryonic_vs_inflamed_colon
This respository contains codes for analysis of scRNAseq data from mouse developing embryonic hindgut (colon) and adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) model. 
For all datasets, normalization, scaling and variable gene selection was performed using R 4.0.0/Rstudio version 1.2.5042. The scRNA-seq analysis was primarily performed using the R package "Seurat" v.3.1.5. Other used R packages include: psupertime version 0.2.6, genesorteR version 0.4.2, matchScore2 version 0.1.0.

All data are available under the GEO accession GSE154007.
